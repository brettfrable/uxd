#INFORMATION

Sense I was not able to use scss, I used a gulp build process that allowed me to create css partials that would concat into a single css file in the build. It also optimizes images.

I also tried to be mindful of accessibility using aria roles and semantic markup. 

I created an icon font for the icons.

I also made use of css grid and css variables sense the requirements for this project stated support only needed to be for the latest versions of chrome / safari. 

Source code can be viewed here in the git repository.

The app folder contains the development files and the dist folder contains the production files.

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. npm Install
3. gulp serve

I used node v9.7.1 if you have any issues.

You can also view the project on a server here.

I enjoyed this project and am definitely looking for feedback.
